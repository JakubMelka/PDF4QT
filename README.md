## 5. CONTRIBUTIONS

If you want to contribute to this project, it is required, that you (contributor)
fill and digitally sign document [Contributor License Agreement](CLA/Contributor_License_Agreement.pdf),
because I want to have a freedom to do whatever I want with my library, without obligation
to someone else. But I would strongly prefer, if you want to contribute, to contribute
in a form of testing, consultation, giving advices etc. I would like to write this library
entirely by myself.

## 6. INSTALLING

### Windows

The [Release page](https://github.com/JakubMelka/PDF4QT/releases) lists binaries for Windows, both with and without an installer.

### Arch Linux

A [pdf4qt-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pdf4qt-git) package is available in the AUR.

## 7. COMPILING

This software can be compiled on both Windows and Linux. A compiler supporting the C++20 standard is needed.

On Windows, you can use Visual Studio 2022 or MinGW.

On Linux, a GCC version >= 8 should work, altough we tested it with GCC 11.

### Compiling from sources

1. Install [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html)

        git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
        ./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh -disableMetrics
        VCPKG_ROOT=$(pwd)/vcpkg

    Check that vcpkg path is correct: `$VCPKG_ROOT/vcpkg --version`.

2. Build PDF4QT

    2.1 Clone repo

        git clone https://github.com/JakubMelka/PDF4QT
        cd PDF4QT

    2.2 Configure

        cmake -B build -S . -DPDF4QT_INSTALL_QT_DEPENDENCIES=0 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$VCPKG_ROOT/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX='/'

    For a debug build, append `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`.

    2.3 Build

        cmake --build build

    Use the [`-j` switch](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#cmdoption-cmake-build-j) to build multiple files in parallel.

    2.4 Install

        sudo cmake --install build

    To uninstall, run `sudo xargs rm < ./build/install_manifest.txt`.

### Using Qt Creator (both Windows/Linux)
1. Download Qt 6.4 or higher, and VCPKG package manager (https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html)
2. Open Qt Creator and configure the project
3. Build
 
### CMAKE Compilation Options

Several important compilation options are available and should be set before building. On Windows,
CMake can prepare a Wix project to create a *.msi installer package.

|                  Option                | Platform |     Description                                          |

| `PDF4QT_INSTALL_QT_DEPENDENCIES`       | Any      |Install Qt dependent libraries into installation directory|

Following important variables should be set or checked before any attempt to compile this project:
